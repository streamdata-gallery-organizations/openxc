description: OpenXC is a combination of open source hardware and software that lets
  you extend your vehicle with custom applications and pluggable modules. It uses
  standard, well-known tools to open up a wealth of data from the vehicle to developers.
  OpenXC is an API to your car - by installing a small hardware module to read and
  translate metrics from a cars internal network, the data becomes accessible from
  most Android applications using the OpenXC library. You can start making vehicle-aware
  applications that have better interfaces based on context, can minimize distraction
  while driving, are integrated with other connected services, and can offer you more
  insight into your cars operation.
